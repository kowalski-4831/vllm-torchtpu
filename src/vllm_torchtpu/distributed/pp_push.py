"""Engine-side part of the pipeline hand-off.

Stages pass activations along with collective launches that all stages issue
together (see ``pp_wave``). Stage 0 launches once after each forward it runs
and every other stage launches once before each forward it runs, so a
forward moves one stage further each time the stages run another forward,
and reaches the last stage once ``stages - 2`` later forwards have run. The
engine dispatches scheduler steps, not forwards: a step with tokens runs at
least one forward on every stage (more when the runner splits it into token
chunks), so a step reaches the last stage once ``stages - 2`` later steps
with tokens have been dispatched, and this module counts steps. While the
engine keeps dispatching, this happens by itself. When the engine stops to
wait for a result before that, the launches that would carry the step the
rest of the way are never issued. This module wraps the executor so that,
in that case, the engine first tells every worker to issue them, one
``pp_push`` per missing step (sent without waiting for a reply), and then
waits. A push is a forward that carries nothing, so the forwards in flight
keep their places and the next real step follows them; nothing drains and
nothing restarts.

The engine and its workers exchange messages through shared-memory ring
buffers, vLLM's ``MessageQueue``, which hold ten messages by default. The
engine's calls go out on one ring that every worker reads; the last stage
reads a step's calls only after several later steps have been dispatched,
so a short ring would block the engine. Each worker's replies come back on
its own ring, which the engine reads in the order it made the calls; with a
KV connector attached every worker replies to every call, so while the
engine waits for the last stage's reply to an old step, the other stages
keep replying to later steps and a short ring fills and blocks them before
they reach the push message. Both rings are widened to
``rpc_ring_chunks`` messages.

The push is installed on ``MultiprocExecutor`` before the executor is
built: from the platform's config check for engines built in this process,
and from the engine-core process otherwise. It is installed once per
process; every executor keeps its own step count and reads its own pipeline
size, so engines of different depths can share a process. Each process
creates its own rings, the engine its broadcast ring and every worker its
reply ring, so the widening is installed in the engine process and, through
``widen_message_rings``, in every worker process; the ring size is the
widest any pipeline in the process asked for.
