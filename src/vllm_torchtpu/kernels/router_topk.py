"""Sort-free top-k expert selection for the MoE router (Pallas).

``torch.topk`` lowers to a full ``stablehlo.sort`` of every expert plus a
slice, so at 512 experts it runs a 45-stage bitonic network over three arrays
to keep 10 values. This kernel selects the same 10 with ``k`` max-and-mask
passes over one VMEM-resident block: ``O(k*N)`` instead of ``O(N*log^2 N)``.
