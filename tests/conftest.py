    libtpu is process-exclusive. A PJRT client built in the pytest PARENT locks
    out every child, and vLLM's engine and workers run in spawned children (see
    VLLM_WORKER_MULTIPROC_METHOD above), so every engine-starting test in the
    run then dies with "pjrt client not initialized" -- far from the module
    that actually claimed the device.

    Collection is import-time, so anything evaluated at module scope counts:
    the usual culprit is a `pytest.mark.skipif(jax.device_count() < N)`, which
    builds a client to answer and does so even when the marker goes on to
    deselect every test in the file. Put that check in a fixture instead; a
    fixture runs at setup, after deselection.

    Checked here rather than left to CI because the failure is invisible to any
    run that does not collect the offending file and an engine test together.
