"""The routing-table identities the fused EP MoE kernel derives rather than ships.

`shard_transport_tables_in_blocks` returns three tables that are the same array
as another it already returns, and the kernel used to have all of them
prefetched into SMEM. Each one is a blocking HBM->SMEM DMA at the head of every
call, on every layer, and the whole scalar prefetch has to fit in 1 MB -- which
it did not under tensor parallelism. So the kernel now takes one copy and
derives the rest.

That is only safe while the identities hold, and they hold for reasons that
live in `build_routing_tables`, not in the shard builders: `region_rows` is
`run_rows_aligned` reshaped, and `recv_base` is a cumsum of ALIGNED run
lengths. Either could reasonably be changed -- tracking true lengths instead of
aligned ones is an obvious future edit -- and the kernel would then address
remote arrivals at the wrong rows, silently, on a shard other than rank 0.
These tests are what would catch that.

The arrays run on CPU. They are `jnp` calls like any other, so on a TPU host
they would otherwise compile and execute on a chip to compute tables that are
pure index arithmetic; `_cpu_backend` below keeps them off it, which is worth
about 3x the wall clock of this file. It does NOT keep the process off the
accelerator -- `jax.devices("cpu")` goes through `backends()`, which builds a
client for every registered platform including TPU. Nothing here needs one, but
do not read the fixture as a claim that the chips stay free.
