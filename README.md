This repo contains TorchTPU + vLLM

The codebase references both vLLM main and tpu-inference, with majority of the server code from vLLM, and custom kernels from tpu-inference

To run Qwen3 model on single device

Start a server:
```
MODEL_IMPL_TYPE="vllm" vllm serve "Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B"     --download_dir /tmp     --disable-log-requests     --tensor_parallel_size=1     --max-model-len=2048 --enforce-eager
```

Send a request:
```
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/completions \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
        "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B",
        "prompt": "Hello, my name is",
        "max_tokens": 20,
        "temperature": 0.7
    }'
```

## Get started

(The following are from tpu-inference, mostly apply)

Get started with vLLM on TPUs by following the [quickstart guide](https://docs.vllm.ai/projects/tpu/en/latest/getting_started/quickstart/).

Visit our [documentation](https://docs.vllm.ai/projects/tpu/en/latest/) to learn more.

**Compatible TPU Generations**
- Recommended: v5e, v6e
- Experimental: v3, v4, v5p

*Check out a few v6e recipes [here](https://github.com/AI-Hypercomputer/tpu-recipes/tree/main/inference/trillium/vLLM)!*
